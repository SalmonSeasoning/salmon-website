    <h3>Welcome!</h3>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>
      You can check out my GitHub account for all my public projects, which consist
      mainly of Discord bots and C++ programs.
      <br />
      Recently I've been interested in Windows DLL injection and Desktop application
      development with C++. If you want to learn more about this, I would check out
      <a href="https://guidedhacking.com">GuidedHacking.com</a> and almost any
      DirectX 12 (D2D/D3D) tutorials on YouTube.
    </p>
    <h3>What languages do I know?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a hobbyist programmer who is pretty experienced in C++ and very experienced in
      JavaScript. I know some other languages, too, but I may not be completely fluent in
      them.
    </p>
    <h3>YouTube</h3>
    <p>
      If you're interested in CS:GO content, you can go check out my YouTube channel
      for some interesting clips. I might upload more content later, but I'm not putting
      dedicated time into YouTube.
